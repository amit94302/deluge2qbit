# deluge2qbit üß≤‚û°Ô∏èüéØ

A Dockerized script to automatically migrate torrents from **Deluge** to **qBittorrent**, applying new categories, tags, and save paths based on Deluge labels.

## üöÄ Features

- **Label-based Migration:** Automatically migrates torrents that have specific Deluge labels (e.g., `radarr-imported`, `sonarr-imported`).
- **Path & Category Mapping:** Sets qBittorrent save path, category, and tags, all configurable per-label.
- **Junk File Cleanup:** Option to remove unnecessary files (.nfo, .txt, .jpg) from the torrent content before adding to qBittorrent.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Fully configurable through environment variables, making it CI/CD friendly.
- **Stateful Migration:** Copies `.torrent` files from the Deluge state directory for a seamless import.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- Running instances of **Deluge** and **qBittorrent**.
- The Deluge Label plugin must be enabled and used to categorize torrents.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Using Docker Compose is the easiest way to run the migration script. You can use the example below as a starting point. For the complete, up-to-date configuration, please refer to the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file, fill in your details (especially passwords and paths), and then run `docker-compose up -d deluge2qbit`.

**Example `docker-compose.yml`:**

```yaml

services:
  deluge2qbit:
    image: amit94302/deluge2qbit:latest
    container_name: deluge2qbit
    environment:
      # --- Deluge Settings ---
      - DELUGE_HOST=deluge
      - DELUGE_PORT=58846
      - DELUGE_USER=admin
      - DELUGE_PASS=your_deluge_password # ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THIS
      - DELUGE_MIGRATE_LABELS=radarr-imported,sonarr-imported
      - DELUGE_REMOVE=true
      # --- qBittorrent Settings ---
      - QBIT_HOST=qbittorrent
      - QBIT_PORT=8080
      - QBIT_USER=admin
      - QBIT_PASS=your_qbit_password # ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THIS
      - QBIT_SET_CATEGORY=true
      - 'QBIT_CATEGORY_MAP=radarr-imported=Movies,sonarr-imported=TV Shows'
      - QBIT_ADD_TAGS=true
      - QBIT_CUSTOM_TAGS=deluge2qbit,migrated
      - QBIT_SAVE_PATH=/downloads/completed
      - QBIT_SKIP_EXTENSIONS=.nfo,.txt,.jpg
      - QBIT_RESUME=true
    volumes:
      # ‚ö†Ô∏è CHANGE THESE HOST PATHS
      # Path where Deluge stores its state files (e.g., torrents, logs)
      - /path/to/your/deluge/config:/deluge
      # Path where your torrent data is stored. This MUST be the same path qBittorrent uses.
      - /path/to/your/downloads:/downloads/completed
      # A temporary path to store .torrent files during migration
      - ./torrents:/torrents
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Docker Run

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -e DELUGE_HOST=deluge \
  -e DELUGE_PORT=58846 \
  -e DELUGE_USER=admin \
  -e DELUGE_PASS=DelugePass \
  -e DELUGE_MIGRATE_LABELS=radarr-imported,sonarr-imported \
  -e QBIT_HOST=qbittorrent \
  -e QBIT_PORT=8080 \
  -e QBIT_USER=admin \
  -e QBIT_PASS=QbittorrentPass \
  -e QBIT_SET_CATEGORY=true \
  -e QBIT_CATEGORY_MAP="radarr-imported=Movies,sonarr-imported=TV Shows" \
  -e QBIT_ADD_TAGS=true \
  -e QBIT_CUSTOM_TAGS=deluge2qbit,torrent-migrator \
  -e QBIT_SAVE_PATH=/downloads/qbit \
  -e QBIT_SKIP_EXTENSIONS=.nfo,.info,.txt,.jpg,.png,.exe,.sfv \
  -e QBIT_RESUME=true \
  -e DELUGE_REMOVE=true \
  -v /path/to/your/deluge/config:/deluge \
  -v /path/to/your/downloads:/downloads/qbit \
  -v ./torrents:/torrents \
  amit94302/deluge2qbit
```

## ü§î How It Works

The script performs the following steps:

1. **Connects** to both the Deluge and qBittorrent clients.
2. **Scans Deluge** for torrents matching the labels defined in `DELUGE_MIGRATE_LABELS`.
3. For each matching torrent, it **copies the `.torrent` file** from the Deluge state directory (`DELUGE_STATE_PATH`) to a temporary location (`TORRENT_FILE_DEST_PATH`).
4. It **adds the torrent to qBittorrent** using the copied `.torrent` file, applying the specified save path, category, and tags.
5. If `QBIT_SKIP_EXTENSIONS` is set, it identifies and **removes junk files** from the torrent content.
6. If `DELUGE_REMOVE` is `true`, it **removes the original torrent** from Deluge.

### Volume Mappings

- `-v /path/to/deluge/config:/deluge`: This maps your Deluge configuration directory into the container. The script needs this to find the `.torrent` files in the `state` sub-directory.
- `-v /path/to/downloads:/downloads/completed`: This maps your main downloads folder. **Crucially, the host path (`/path/to/downloads`) should be the same one that both Deluge and qBittorrent use.** This allows qBittorrent to find the data and re-check it without re-downloading.
- `-v ./torrents:/torrents`: A temporary folder on the host to store `.torrent` files during the migration process. You can create an empty `torrents` directory in the same folder as your `docker-compose.yml`.
